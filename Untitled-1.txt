transitions between high-quality images of the interior, exterior, and dishes.

devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The layout should adapt seamlessly to
different screen sizes.

their branding. Implement these design choices throughout the website using CSS to ensure a
consistent and professional appearance.

Interactive Elements: Add an interactive Google Map to the contact page, allowing customers
to easily locate the restaurant. Additionally, implement subtle hover effects for menu items and
navigation links to enhance the user experience.

navigation menu collapses into a hamburger menu for better usability. Adjust the layout and
font sizes for optimal mobile viewing.
